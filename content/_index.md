<br>Welcome to my personal blog where I share my thoughts, best practices, and real-world experience in software engineering.<br>

<br>Mostly Java, Spring, and the things that just work.<br>

<br>When I'm not coding, I'm probably somewhere riding my motorcycle or drinking coffee like it's my second job.<br>
